# Backlog
Updated: 2026-08-30

- Move specs/rls-isolation-findings.md to docs/ (update CLAUDE.md pointer).
- Inbox search RPC fix (Option C). Day 7.
- Stripe line-item audit on checkout/invoice. Day 7.
- Pipeline order/invoice enrichment. After Day 7.
- vitest include should be restricted to src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx} before Playwright specs land (B1) — otherwise e2e/*.spec.ts is collected too.
- Schema snapshot (supabase db dump --schema public) deferred: CLI login-role conflict (cli_login_postgres); needs --db-url with DB password or role cleanup. Do before Day 9.
- Prune the 9 unreferenced template agents in .claude/agents/ (code-refactorer … translation-auditor) — none used; decide keep/delete in Day 12 cleanup.
